					<p class="text-medium" align="justify">
						Seelio is a career development platform for students that is currently observing <span class = "bold">lack of engagement</span> from its students and poor user retention.
						Although problem was visible, the root causes remained hidden.<br></p>

					<h4 class="myblue bold lead top-margin-30">Solution</span></h4>
					<p class="text-medium" align="justify">
					Our team of four is in the process of interviewing users and stakeholders to understand the gap between users and Seelio. Interviews helped us understand probable reasons of breakdown.
					As a final report, we will provide recommendations on Seelio's <span class = "bold"> discoverability, user interface and information architecture </span> to facilitate active student engagement.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<!-- <div class="sectionproject" id="backgroundresearch"><br> -->
				<br><p class="lead"><span class = "myblue bold">Background Research</span></p>
				<p>As the first part of contextual inquiry, we were taught to look both inside and outside the organization.  We had a preliminary meeting with the client where we discussed about the problem Seelio is currently trying to address.</p><br>

				<p>From the initial discussion, we realized that a recurring issue with Seelio was <span class = "bold">constant realignment of the organization's goals.</span>
				Seelio started as a recruitment platform for students, then moved into educational services and partnered with universities and faculty. Currently, Seelio is in the process of yet another pivot towards a career development platform, closer to the domain they started off with.</p><br>

				We wanted to understand this behaviour and decided to conduct a background research on the organization. Instead of all four of us focussing on one line of research, we decided to conduct this study individually, each of us through a different lens.
				We conducted a competitive analysis, a target user group analysis and I specifically assessed Seelio as an <span class = "bold">online community.</span><br><br>

				<p>Analyzing Seelio as an online commnity provided great insights into the levels of engagement within the users, especially since that was the area where they were observing lack of activity. I assessed Seelio mainly on the following criteria:</p>
				<p>Interaction with system<br>
				   Information structure<br>
				   New user socialization<br>
				   User interactions
				</p><br>
				<p>Seelio has a very intuitive interface and a very well laid out new user socialization. However, the <span class = "bold">architecture of Seelio and its privacy and permission settings seemed to counterproductive to sharing and engagement.</span></p><br>
				<p>For example, Seelio has 'groups' for specific departments and courses so that students can affiliate a particular piece of work with a class. But the permissions of this group are completely controlled by the group's admin and allows for very little interaction from non-members. A non-member can only view the work and like it. The discussion forum and work sharing is closed for them.</p><br>
			<!-- </div>

			<div class="sectionproject" id="interviews"> -->
				<p class="lead"><span class = "myblue bold">Interview Protocol</span></p>
				<p>After the background research, each of us presented our findings to the team and tried to find common problems that surfaced. This exercise gave us the grounds to identify possible interviwees that we would talk to and prepare interview protocols for each of them. We also took pointers from the persona that Seelio provided us through their research.</p><br>

				<p>We identified 5 categories of users we would like to interview:</p>
				1. A active Seelio user.<br>
				2. A dormant or former Seelio user.<br>
				3. A designer working with Seelio.<br>
				4. A sales/marketing rep working with Seelio.<br>
				5. A recruiter.<br><br>

				<img src="img/seeliopersona.jpg" alt="Persona" title="Persona" class="img-responsive"/><br><br>

				<p>For each of these users, we had some overarching questions that we needed answers to at the end of the interview. Some of the insights we hoped to gain from these interviews were:</p><br>
				1. What <span class = "bold">value</span> does Seelio provide to a student?<br>
				2. What are the companies <span class = "bold">business goals</span> and how does the product fit into those?<br>
				3. What value does a <span class = "bold">student/user</span> see in Seelio?<br>
				4. Where did Seelio <span class = "bold">fall short</span> in addressing the users that abandoned the community?<br>
				5. What value does a <span class = "bold">recruiter</span> get from Seelio over other platforms used by him?<br><br>

				<p class="lead"><span class = "myblue bold">Interviews</span></p>
				<p>Seelio had conducted very basic survey on user demographics and their overall experience of using Seelio. The survey results saw user ratings right from 0 up to 10. We decided to recruit 2 users who gave favourable rating to Seelio, 2 users who gave unfavourable rating to Seelio and an employer who has successfully recruited a student through Seelio.<br><br>
				<p>Each interview was conducted with an interviewer-note-taker pair and audio recorded.	We got some great insights from the student interviews, however the employer interview was a bust. We could not find an employer that was actively using Seelio, and the client also stressed that they do not wish to focus on employers at the moment. Looking back, if we had some more time and flexibility, we would have loved to understand the employers perspective around this process.<br><br>
				<p>At the end of each interview, the pair went over the notes and recording and created relevant annotations. Through these annotations, we were able to create the building blocks of our affinity wall:</p>
				1. <span class = "bold">Important interview insights</span> - Little insights around the system.<br>
				2. <span class = "bold">User quotes</span> - quotes that particularly stood out for us.<br>
				3. <span class = "bold">Follow-up questions</span> - Some questions that could have been framed better or needed some follow-up.<br>
				4. <span class = "bold">Design ideas</span> - Rough design ideas.<br>

			<!-- </div>

			<div class="sectionproject" id="affinitywall"> -->
				<br><p class="lead"><span class = "myblue bold">Affinity Wall</span></p>
				<p>Once we completed annotations for all the interviews, we began working on the affinity wall. We created affinity notes for every users with U1, U2 etc as the user codes.<br><br>
				In the first round of affinity we arranged all the notes under rough categories such as: UI problems, architecture problems, portfolio issues, discoverability issues, level of engagement etc. This first round of categorization was overwhelming due to its sheer size.<br><br>
				In the second round, we split up some of the columns that were too big into more relevant sections and reorganized some notes that no longer made sense in their present category. In this second round, we tried to <span class = "bold">correlate different categories </span>to understand patterns between them.<br><br>
				For example, user 4 quoted <span class = "bold">'Portfolio to me is a visual representation of my work'</span>, the same user complained about lack of customization on Seelio around design and talked about moving to a different portfolio platform.<br><br>
				Over the next week we plan to further organize our affinity wall into more higher-level issues and come up with more concrete design ideas.</p><br>
